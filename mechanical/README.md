## Parametric Wearable Actuator Array Design Tool
This repository contains Grasshopper scripts for generating customizable 3D-printable wearable actuator arrays. The parametric system enables rapid design iteration and customization for diverse body placements and application requirements.
Overview
The design tool creates actuator arrays with parametric control over geometry, spacing, and configuration. Based on psychophysical analysis, the system focuses on the most effective form factors: bracelet and necklace configurations, while supporting additional variations.

### Prerequisites
- Rhino 3D (latest version recommended)
- Grasshopper (included with Rhino)
- Basic familiarity with Grasshopper's visual programming interface
